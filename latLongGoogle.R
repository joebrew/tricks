#### Latitude, longitude, location type (see explanation at the end), formatted address

#Location type, for more info check here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/
#"ROOFTOP" indicates that the returned result is a precise geocode for which we have location information accurate down to street address precision.
#RANGE_INTERPOLATED" indicates that the returned result reflects an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two precise points (such as intersections). Interpolated results are generally returned when rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address.
#GEOMETRIC_CENTER" indicates that the returned result is the geometric center of a result such as a polyline (for example, a street) or polygon (region).
#APPROXIMATE" indicates that the returned result is approximate.
